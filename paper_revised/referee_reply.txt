Dear A&A Editor,

Thank you for sending us the report of the referee, whom we thank for
carefully reading our manuscript and providing very useful feedback. We 
have made several changes addressing the issues raised in the report, 
which are listed below together with our response. The changes made in 
the manuscript are highlighted in boldface, to facilitate identification. 
We hope that with these amendments the paper will be considered 
acceptable for publication on Astronomy and Astrophysics.

       Best wishes,

       The authors

We agree with the referee about the title being colloquial. Our choice was
motivated by the title of the paper of Qian et al (2009), “The Polish 
doughnuts revisited …”, of which our paper might be considered an extension 
(by incorporating magnetic fields). We would prefer to keep the original 
title, if the referee concurred. If that were not the case, we would not
object to having it changed to his/her suggestion. (“A new method for the
construction of magnetized tori around black holes”.)

We have followed the recomendation of the referee and in the revised version
of the paper only mentions to “fluid pressure”, “magnetic pressure”, and 
“total pressure” appear. Those appearances are highlighted in boldface
throughout.

Done.

We have incorporated in the article the first and the third references 
suggested by the referee. However, we have not incorporated the second 
reference. While this is a very relevant work in the context of oscillations 
of non-constant-angular momentum disks, including this reference in our 
work seems to us a bit forced since it discusses aspects which are a bit 
away from the main discourse of our paper.
