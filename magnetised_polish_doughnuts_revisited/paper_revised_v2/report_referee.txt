> The paper presents a new procedure to construct sequences of equilibrium
> tori around Kerr black holes that are endowed with a toroidal magnetic
> field. These configurations are not expected to be produced under generic
> conditions but the construction of such equilibria is interesting per se
> and has a rather long history. Furthermore, as discussed by the authors,
> the availability of such equilibria can be employed in test simulations
> of general-relativistic codes in ideal MHD.

> The paper is nicely written with a clear discussion of the procedure
> followed and of the properties of the tori that have been found. The
> paper is essentially ready for publication but there are a few aspects
> that could be improved and that I ask the authors to consider.

> - Title: I frankly find it unnecessarily colloquial. I do not insist but

> - Sec. 2.1: they introduce the equation of state (13) but do not discuss
> how they treat the specific internal energy that is part of the
> enthalpy used in (13). A comment should be added.

> still unclear how the strength of this component is specified. A

> - Sec. 2.1: More on this topic: do the fluid isobaric surfaces (i.e. the
> surfaces of constant fluid pressure) coincide with the magnetic
> isobaric surfaces (i.e. the surfaces of constant magnetic pressure)?
> How are these surfaces related to the iso-density surfaces? A comment
> should be added.
> 

> - Sec. 3: the authors are a bit too sloppy when referring to the fluid
> pressure, which they call respectively: "fluid pressure", "gas
> pressure" "thermal pressure", and sometimes simply as "pressure". Since
> distinguishing the fluid, magnetic and total pressure is important, I
> ask the authors to always just talk of "fluid pressure".

> - Sec. 3: similar considerations apply to the density, which should
> be referred to as "rest-mass density"
> 

> - Sec. 3: the authors discuss that the rest-mass density distribution can
> "be trivially obtained inverting the barotropic relation, p = K
> rho^kappa". I am not sure this is so trivial unless an assumption is
> made on the specific internal energy; the authors should discuss more
> clearly how they actually obtain the density from Eqs. (12) and (14).
> 

> - Sec. 3: the authors discuss that Eq. (24) diverges for theta --> pi/2,
> i.e. at the equator. I am a bit puzzled by this statement and I wonder if
> this is an exact statement, ie whether it is true that

> partial_theta W = 0 for theta --> pi/2.

> If this is an exact result, I urge the authors to prove it. If it is
> not, I urge the authors to simply mention that the gradients become
> very small.

> - Fig. 1: as with the middle panel, I suggest that the right
> panel should also show the logarithm of the rest-mass density.
> 

> - Fig. 2: all of the panels would benefit from a legend showing the
> corresponding values of gamma and beta. This would avoid having to read the caption repeatdly. The same is true also for Fig. 3.
> 

> - Fig. 4: the caption should be corrected in "beta = 10^3 --> beta_{m_c}
> = 10^3".

> - Fig. 4: the authors do not discuss what is the largest magnetization
> that they can handle. I agree that beta_{m_c} = 10^{-3} is probably
> already quite high, but what happens for say beta_{m_c} = 10^{-6}? Can
> a solution still be found?

> - Sec. 4: I find the discussion in this section the less clear; a lot
> of the considerations appear phenomenological but I can't find the
> simple back-of-the-envelope demonstration that what the authors observe
> numerically is what should be expected on physical grounds. For
> example, the authors find that the rho_max increases with magnetization
> (left panel of Fig. 6) or that the position of the rest-mass density
> maximum moves in with increasing magnetization (middle panel of
> Fig. 6). What are the physical reasons for this behavior? I have some
> suggestions on this but I urge the authors to provide some simple and
> intuitive explanations first.
